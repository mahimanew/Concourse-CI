### 2. **Basic Concourse Pipeline**

#### 2.1 **Setting Up a Simple Pipeline from a YAML File**

Concourse pipelines are defined using YAML files, which specify the jobs, resources, and tasks. In this section, we'll walk through setting up a basic pipeline that prints a simple message. Here's how to start:

##### Step 1: Create a Pipeline YAML File

Create a new file called `pipeline.yml`. This file will define your basic pipeline. Here's an example YAML configuration:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: say-hello
    plan:
      - task: print-message
        config:
          platform: linux
          image_resource:
            type: registry-image
            source:
              repository: busybox
          run:
            path: echo
            args: ["Hello, Concourse!"]
```

**Explanation:**
- **jobs:** This defines a list of jobs. In this case, we have a single job called `say-hello`.
- **task:** The `print-message` task is executed within the job.
- **config:** Specifies the environment the task runs in. We use a lightweight `busybox` Docker image to execute a simple task.
- **run:** Defines the command to run inside the container. The task runs `echo "Hello, Concourse!"`, which prints the message to the terminal.

##### Step 2: Upload the Pipeline to Concourse

To upload this pipeline to Concourse, you need to use the `fly` CLI, which is Concourse’s command-line tool. Follow these steps:

1. **Login to Concourse using `fly`:**
   - Run the command to login:
     ```bash
     fly -t my-target login -c http://localhost:8080 -u test -p test
     ```
     Replace `my-target` with the name of your target, and `http://localhost:8080` with the URL of your Concourse instance.

2. **Set the pipeline:**
   - Run the following command to set the pipeline from the `pipeline.yml` file:
     ```bash
     fly -t my-target set-pipeline -p hello-pipeline -c pipeline.yml
     ```
   - `-p hello-pipeline` specifies the name of your pipeline.
   - `-c pipeline.yml` specifies the pipeline configuration file.

3. **Unpause the pipeline:**
   - By default, pipelines are paused after being set. Unpause it with this command:
     ```bash
     fly -t my-target unpause-pipeline -p hello-pipeline
     ```

##### Step 3: Trigger the Pipeline

After setting and unpausing the pipeline, manually trigger the job:

```bash
fly -t my-target trigger-job -j hello-pipeline/say-hello
```

You can also trigger the job through the Concourse web UI by navigating to the pipeline and clicking the job.

#### 2.2 **Pipeline Configuration Syntax**

Concourse pipelines follow a specific syntax in YAML format. Here's an overview of the important elements in a basic pipeline configuration:

- **`jobs`:** Jobs define the units of work, consisting of tasks that need to be executed.
- **`plan`:** A job’s plan is a sequence of steps, such as `get` (fetch a resource), `put` (publish a resource), or `task` (run a task).
- **`task`:** A task defines a single step in the job and requires:
  - **`platform`:** The environment where the task will run. Usually `linux`.
  - **`image_resource`:** The Docker image used to run the task. It can be a lightweight image like `busybox`, or a more complex environment.
  - **`run`:** The command to run within the container and any arguments to pass to the command.

#### 2.3 **Creating a Basic Job with a Simple Task**

In the previous example, we defined a basic job called `say-hello` with one task: `print-message`. This task simply prints a message. You can try modifying the task to perform different actions.

**Example: Modify Task to Perform Basic Math Operation**

Let's change the task to perform a basic arithmetic operation:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: say-hello
    plan:
      - task: calculate-sum
        config:
          platform: linux
          image_resource:
            type: registry-image
            source:
              repository: busybox
          run:
            path: sh
            args: ["-c", "expr 5 + 3"]
```

- **task:** We renamed the task to `calculate-sum`.
- **run:** The task now runs `sh -c "expr 5 + 3"`, which calculates `5 + 3` and prints the result.

#### 2.4 **Viewing Pipeline Output**

Once the job runs, you can view its output in the Concourse UI:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Click on the pipeline you set (`hello-pipeline`).
3. Click on the `say-hello` job and view the output logs for the task.

This step allows you to check if the task succeeded and see the printed message or result of the operation.

#### 2.5 **Practice:**

1. Modify the pipeline to run a different command (e.g., print the current date, perform a mathematical operation).
2. Add a second job to the pipeline that triggers after the first job completes successfully.
3. Explore different Docker images for running tasks.
